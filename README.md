# Elysium
Mobile port of Elysium mod. Mod requires and uses [Hotkey Adapter](https://github.com/Jai-ACS/Mod-HotkeyAdapter) mod to bridge the original requirement for hotkeys, which most mobile devices are incapable of performing. The mod continues to support hotkeys for mobile devices that are connected to a keyboard device, though the game itself does not support configuration of hotkeys.

# Main Features
1. Automate cultivation for inner disciples
	* Automate switching between cultivation (Practice or Train mode) and recovery (Mind mode), based on Mental State

2. One-Click toggle equipped/unequipped talismans for the currently selected disciple
	* Note: Not very useful without hotkey
3. One-Click placement/removal of items onto/from displays
	* Used mainly for Manual Qi Bursting
4. Toggle the automatic equipping and unequipping of Mental State boosting talismans for enhanced cultivation to recovery ratio
	* Note: The status is currently only visible in the explanation / instruction pop-up
5. Automatically treat injuries with "Spirit" tag
6. Automatically collect and send artifacts to Sword Shield building
